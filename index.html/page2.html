        <h3>What is Fortnite?</h3>
        <body>
          <p>Fortnite is a wildly popular online video game that has taken the gaming world by storm. It's essentially a battle royale game, where a hundred players are dropped onto an ever-shrinking island and compete until only one person or team is left standing.
          What makes Fortnite stand out is its unique blend of intense combat, creative building mechanics, and a vibrant, ever-evolving world. Players can harvest resources and construct structures on the fly, adding a strategic layer to the game. Besides the core battle royale mode, 
          Fortnite offers various limited-time events and creative modes where players can build and create their own unique experiences. With its colorful graphics, frequent updates, and a strong social aspect, it has captured the hearts of gamers and even those who might not typically play video games, 
          making it a cultural phenomenon.</p>
