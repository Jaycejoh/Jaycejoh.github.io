        <h3>What is Fortnite?</h3>
        <body>
          <p>Fortnite is a wildly popular online video game that has taken the gaming world by storm. It's essentially a battle royale game, where a hundred players are dropped onto an ever-shrinking island and compete until only one person or team is left standing.
          What makes Fortnite stand out is its unique blend of intense combat, creative building mechanics, and a vibrant, ever-evolving world. Players can harvest resources and construct structures on the fly, adding a strategic layer to the game. Besides the core battle royale mode, 
          Fortnite offers various limited-time events and creative modes where players can build and create their own unique experiences. With its colorful graphics, frequent updates, and a strong social aspect, it has captured the hearts of gamers and even those who might not typically play video games, 
          making it a cultural phenomenon.</p>

        <p>Fortnite's history is a testament to its rapid rise and transformative impact on the gaming industry. Developed by Epic Games, the game was initially released as "Fortnite: Save the World" in July 2017, focusing on a cooperative player vs. environment mode. However, 
        the turning point came in September 2017 when Epic introduced "Fortnite Battle Royale," a free-to-play mode that pits players against each other in a last-person-standing battle. This move catapulted Fortnite to worldwide fame, quickly amassing millions of players and viewers on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. 
        The game's playful graphics, engaging building mechanics, and frequent updates created an addictive and ever-evolving experience. Fortnite also pioneered the "Battle Pass" system, offering in-game purchases for cosmetic items, which proved immensely profitable. Its cultural impact extended beyond gaming, with dance emotes,
        in-game concerts, and celebrity endorsements. Fortnite's history showcases how a well-executed concept, coupled with regular updates and community engagement, can turn a game into a global cultural phenomenon.</p>
