        <h3>History of Competitive Fortnite</h3>
      </header>
        <body>
          <p>Competitive Fortnite emerged shortly after the game's battle royale mode was introduced in 2017. The competitive scene initially took shape with informal online tournaments and grassroots events. 
          However, the turning point came with the introduction of the Fortnite World Cup in 2019, where Epic Games offered a staggering $30 million in prize money, which was the largedt tournament in esports history. 
          This tournament brought together top players from around the world and solidified Fortnite's position as a major esport. They hosted a solos and duos tournament in world cup, each for $15 million in prize money.
          You had to qualify online in one of ten weeks to make it to the big tournament. Prize money was handed out to players close to qualifying too, which was hundreds of thousands of dollars. Six games were played
          at the Fortnite World cup in each of solos and duos, with first place receiving $3 million in each game mode, and last place receiving $50 thousand. There were 100 players competing in each mode, with some players
          playing in both. The Fortnite World cup Solo winner was Kyle Giersdorf, who goes by the name Bugha, who was also just 16 years old. The Fortnite World Cup Duos winner's were Emil Bergquist and David Wang, who go by
          Nyhrox and Aqua, who were also just 16 and 17 years old.</p>
          <p>Fortnite has hosted thousands of online tournaments and some in person tournaments for millions of dollars but nothing like the Fortnite World Cup. Recently, on Ocobert 13th of 2023, Fortnite hosted another larger
          in person tournament, which was the biggest since the World Cup, with a total prize of $4 million with the best players around the world. It was duos and the winners were Matthew Faitel and Cooper Smith, who go
          by Mero and Cooper, and are just 19 and 16 years old, winning a prize of $1 million.</p>
          <p> Fortnite has the most opportunities for players to make money from playing video games. Anyone can play the online tournaments, which they host weekly, and you just have to practice a ton and you can easily become
          a pro.</p>
